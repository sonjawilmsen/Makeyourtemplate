# Makeyourtemplate
Template editor based on Ruby on Rails - Work in progress

This project was our final assignment for the Codaisseur program. In a 2 day hackathon we worked on this project which is based on Ruby on Rails. The website shows you a basic template on the left, if you click on a section you get edit choices on the right (color and font for h1 and p at the moment).
In the beginning it was hard to set up because we were not sure what the best way was to get the user iinput and then update our data. With some help from our tutors we started working and got quite far. 

I worked on creating the default template and adding it to the seed file, created the form section and made it possible to download the css part of the template the user created. 

It is a work in progress because not all sections are editable and there is work to be done on the styling.
